            <h4><b>Mauritania</b>, officially the <b>Islamic Republic of Mauritania</b>, is a sovereign country in <b>Northwest Africa</b>. <br> It is bordered by the <b>Atlantic Ocean</b> to <b>the west,
             Western Sahara</b> to the north and northwest, <b>Algeria</b> to the northeast, <b>Mali</b> to the east and southeast, and <b>Senegal</b> to the southwest. <br>
              By land area <b>Mauritania</b> is </b>the 11th-largest country in Africa and 28th-largest in the world</b>; <b>90%</b> of its territory is in the Sahara. <br>
               Most of its population of some <b>4.3 million</b> lives in the temperate south of the country, with roughly a third concentrated in the capital and largest city, 
            <b>Nouakchott</b>, on the Atlantic coast. <br><br>
            The country's name derives from the ancient <b>Berber kingdom of Mauretania </b>in North Africa within the ancient <b>Maghreb</b>. 
            Berbers occupied what is now Mauritania beginning in <b>the third century AD</b>. 
            Arabs under <b>the Umayyad Caliphate</b> conquered the area in the late seventh century, bringing Islam, Arab culture, and the Arabic language. 
            In the early <b>20th century</b>, Mauritania was colonized by <b>France</b> as part of French West Africa. 
            It achieved <b>independence in 1960</b>, but has since experienced recurrent coups and periods of military dictatorship. 
            The most recent coup, in <b>2008</b>, was led by <b>General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz</b>, who won subsequent presidential elections in <b>2009</b> and <b>2014</b>.
            He was succeeded by <b>General Mohamed Ould Ghazouani</b> following the <b>2019 elections</b>, which were considered Mauritania's first peaceful transition of power since independence. <br>
       <br><b>Mauritania</b> is culturally and politically part of <b>the Arab world</b>; it is a member of <b>the Arab League and Arabic</b> is the official language. 
            The official religion is <b>Islam</b>, and almost all inhabitants are <b>Sunni Muslims</b>. 
            Despite its prevailing Arab identity, Mauritanian society is multiethnic; <b>the Bidhan</b>, or so-called <b>"white moors"</b>, make up <b>30% </b>of the population,
             while <b>the Haratin</b>, or so-called <b>"black moors"</b>, comprise 40%. Both groups reflect a fusion of Arab-Berber ethnicity, 
             language, and culture. The remaining 30% of the population comprises various sub-Saharan ethnic groups. <br><br>
             Despite an abundance of natural resources, including iron ore and petroleum, Mauritania remains poor; its economy is based primarily on agriculture, livestock, and fishing. 
             Mauritania is generally seen as having a poor human rights record, and is particularly censured for the perpetuation of slavery as an institution within Mauritanian society, 
             with an estimation by the 2018 Global Slavery Index of about <b>90,000</b> slaves in the country <b>(or 2.1% of the population)</b>.

            <h1 style=" text-decoration: underline; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Etymology:</h1> <br><br>
            <h4> Mauritania takes its name from the ancient Berber kingdom that flourished beginning in <b>the third century BC </b>and later became the Roman province of Mauretania,
                 which flourished into <b>the seventh century AD</b>. The two territories do not overlap, though; historical Mauretania was considerably farther north than modern Mauritania,
                  as it was spread out along the entire western half of the Mediterranean coast of Africa. The term <b>"Mauretania"</b>, in turn, derives from the <b>Greek </b>and <b>Roman</b>
                   exonym for the Berber peoples of the kingdom, <b>the Mauri people</b>. The word <b>"Mauri"</b> is also the root of the name for the <b>Moors</b>. <br><br>
                It was more commonly known to Arab geographers as <b>Bilad Chinqit</b>, <b>"the land of the Chinguetti"</b>.
                 The term <b>"Mauritanie occidentale"</b> was officially used in a ministerial circular in <b>1899</b>, based on a proposal by <b>Xavier Coppolani</b>, 
                    a French military and colonial leader, who was instrumental in the colonial occupation and creation of modern-day Mauritania. This term, 
                    employed by the French, gradually replaced other designations previously used for referring to the country.
